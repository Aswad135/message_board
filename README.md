# message_board

This is a demo project of Message Board prepared to show my technical skills by creating a RestAPI based CRUD Application. 
This is solely for Technical Assesment for Konstant Variables.

To import and build the project follow the steps below.
1. Clone the repository in Intellij IDEA (thats my preference, you may use any ide of your choice).
2. Run Maven Clean Install 
3. Anc Run the Application using Built-in Run Configurator of IDEA.

I have added some JUnit Tests in the Apllication that can be used to test if the application is properly built and is running in your machine.

Also I am Uploading a Postman Request Collection as well on this [Link](https://github.com/Aswad135/message_board/blob/bccb4d1cc3ecf72c193236d55864347b2fa08c5a/Message%20Board.postman_collection.json) that can be imported into postman to test and verify the working of these APIs.
